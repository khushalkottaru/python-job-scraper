This project is a configurable job scraper built with Python and Beautiful Soup that allows users to find relevant job postings. It scrapes job listings from a practice website, filters them based on user-defined keywords, and saves the results to a CSV file. All settings, including keywords, the number of jobs to scrape, and the output file name, are managed through a config.json file for easy customization without needing to modify the source code.
